# Classification-Project
Famous artists frequently have a distinct style which a casual viewer can easily identify the artist that created a painting. However, occasionally experts even debate over who the artist was or if a painting is a fake. We will use machine learning techniques to determine if we can find a classification algorithm that can identify artists given painting features as well as the casual viewer can.
